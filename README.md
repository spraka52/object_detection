## Project Overview

The TensorFlow Object Detection API simplifies the process of training, evaluating, and deploying object detection models. This repository demonstrates how to set up and run models using TensorFlow’s high-level detection API.

## Features

* Ready-to-use scripts and notebooks for model training and evaluation
* Support for common architectures (e.g., SSD, Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN)
* Easy configuration of training parameters
* Automated export of inference graphs for deployment

## Environment Setup

* **Python:** 3.7.3
* **Framework:** TensorFlow (1.x or 2.x compatible)
* **Environment Manager:** Anaconda

### Required Packages

* numpy
* tkinter
* matplotlib
* tensorflow

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```
2. **Create and activate conda environment**

   ```bash
   conda create -n tfod_env python=3.7.3
   conda activate tfod_env
   ```
3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install numpy tkinter matplotlib tensorflow
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare test images** Place your test images in the `object_detection/test_images/` folder.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook object_detection.ipynb
   ```

3. **Follow the notebook cells**

   * Load labels and config
   * Perform inference on test images
   * Visualize detection results
